# **sfpegMultiValueSelectorCmp** Component
---


## Introduction

The **sfpegMultiValueSelectorCmp** component enables to display and edit a set of picklist fields
on the current record leveraging a same set of values provided by a multi-picklist field, each
value being used max once.

A typical use case (shown in the snapshots) is to define a set of available communication channels 
on a parent campaign and leverage this set of channels to choose a primary and a secondary channel
on a sub-campaign.


## Component Behaviour

By default, the **sfpegMultiValueSelectorCmp** component is displayed in read mode, each picklist
field being initialized with its value fetched via **[Lightning Data Service](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.reference_wire_adapters_record)**.

When clicking on the `edit` button, it switches to edit mode with `cancel` and `validation` buttons displayed.
The dropdowns are then automatically populated and available to set/update the picklist fields.

The set of possible values is provided by the multi-picklist field configured (fetched also via
**Lightning Data Service**) and it is then progressively filtered out depending on the values
set on the picklist fields (depending on their orders). In the snapshot above, the user cannot
select `SMS` for the second picklist because it is set on the first field.

When the user updates a field, if the new value is used by a next field (i.e. on the right), this next
field is automatically reset to null.

The dropdowns are then automatically updated.

The user may then opt to validate the change or cancel it.


## Configuration

All the configuration of the **sfpegMultiValueSelectorCmp** component is done in the App Builder.

The configuration is quite straightforwards:
* `Title` defines the left text header
* `Multi-Value Field` sets the multi-select field (by its API Name) providing the eligible picklist values
* `Picklist Fields` sets the list of picklist fields (by their API Names) to be displayed/edited.

The `Wrapping CSS Class` property enables to adapt the style of the component container, e.g. to act on
its border, padding, background color... leveraging standard SLDS classes available.

_Note_: Lookup relations may be used when providing the API name of the multi-p√Æcklist field, e.g. 
`Parent.Canaux__c` to display the set of channels registered on a parent Campaign.


## Technical Details

The component relies on multiple LWC wire services:
* **[getRecord](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.reference_wire_adapters_record)** to fetch current record's data
* **[updateRecord](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.reference_update_record)** to update the current record
* **[getObjectInfo](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.reference_wire_adapters_object_info)** to fetch the picklist field labels
